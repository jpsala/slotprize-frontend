Support Administration - 1 Day


In this page the producer will be able to configure the mail address that will receive the support messages sent through the form in the app.

Also, if possible, add a history of the messages received with the info of the player that has sent the message + the written message of the player. IF YOU HAVE TIME maybe you can add a simple Flag next to each ticket (message) with the following status: NEW, OPEN, CLOSED. This flag will be 100% controlled by the producer, for the moment there's no system or logic that changes this status dynamically.
